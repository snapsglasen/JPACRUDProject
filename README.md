# JPACRUDProject #

##Description##

	This application works by taking an entity and its fields from a single table in an SQL database and implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations to be performed on said entity via JSPs which give the front end view for the user, data accessor object (DAO) which provides the backend logic of the application's CRUD methods, and a controller which ties both the DAO and the JSPs together through pathways and ModelAndViews. The user is presented with a basic HTML home screen that will allow a search by the entity, based on Japanese Tohoku and Hokkaido prefectural data, ID number which in turn displays all the fields of a Prefecture entity. The user then is given the option to return to the home screen or delete/update the displayed Prefecture.

##Lessons Learned##

	Of all the projects I've done at Skill Distillery to date, this has by far been the most challenging. The first and most important lesson I learned was twofold: 1- how calmness in the face of wild frustration is NECESSARY in order to complete any given task, and 2- programming is a team sport; without the help of my peers, teachers, and other examples from past projects and online searches, I would not have come close to finishing this project (at least not on time). The primary thing I got, in terms of coding, out of this project is finally having a firm grasp on how controllers work, which to be honest has been beyond mystifying until now. This is the first full-stack application I can proudly say I am responsible for.
